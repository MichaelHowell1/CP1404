# Cp1404 Practical

This repository contains the code for Cp1404 practicals at James Cook University by Michael Howell.

## Lessons Learned

- Clean code is not only important for professionalism and neatness but is important in ensuring that any errors can
  quickly and easily be found and addressed.
- While functions may work otherwise using the single-responsibility principle (SRP) allows code to be more easily
  followed.
- Meaningful names are vital to ensure traceability and provide information about the variables in a program.

## Programing Patterns
